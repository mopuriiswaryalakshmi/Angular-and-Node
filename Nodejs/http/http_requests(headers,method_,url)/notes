The HTTP response is what enables us to send data back to the clients from our Node servers.

response.writeHead is a method that is used to set the status code and create HTTP headers. Two most common HTTP headers are Content-Type and Content-Length:

response.writeHead(200, {
  'Content-Length': body.length,
  'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })

  The response itself is created with the write() method 
  which adds data to the response. 
  Another method is end() which finishes the response 
  (which in turn will finish the incoming request). 
  You can set the statusCode attribute to change the status 
  code of the response (200, 400, 500, etc.).

  write() -> which adds data to the response
  end()  ->  which finishes the response
  statusCode  -> to change the status code of the response (200, 400, 500, etc.).
