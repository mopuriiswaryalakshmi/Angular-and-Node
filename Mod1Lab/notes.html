    <!--purpose of $scope in an Angular application ->
         The $scope object is used to make the model available to the view-->
    <!-- Have an HTML file for the view (i.e. index.html)
        Load the Angular library in a script tag
        Declare an Angular module
        Declare an Angular Controller
        Use ng-controller to bind the Controller to the View
        Use an Angular Expression to bind the date value to the View
        Use the JavaScript Date Object to generate the date.
        Use Dependency Injection to get the date value from the constant. -->
    <!--Be sure to put your declarations in order (Angular, then App declaration, then constant, then controller. This will ensure you have no errors. -->
        <!-- Q> implementing Dependency Injection within your app.   -->
        <!-- A>app.controller("myCtrlr", ["$scope", function($scope) { } ]); -->
        <!-- Q>you use to get started on this task -->
        <!-- A>app.controller('mainController', [ ]);  -->
        <!-- Q>you were tasked with binding your Controller to the View. -->
        <!-- A>< body ng-controller="mainController" > correct -->  

    
    <!-- ng-controller is controller to view -->
    <!-- ng-model    is view to controller
        view to the controller with ng-model to a different place in the view so that we can display the value as it is changing -->
    <!--When  working with $scope variables communication between the view and the controller can go both ways-->
    <!-- view can update automatically when the $scope variable's value changes in the controller,  -->
    <!-- changes in the view can also cause the $scope variable's value to change in the controller. -->
    <!-- If it's ng-model, it needs a dot in it. -->
    <!-- ng-model works on the concept of inheritance -->
    <!--  in more complicated applications the inheritance can be lost when ng-model is used without using a subproperty of an object.The standard rule is:If it's ng-model, it needs a dot in it.-->
    <!--  in larger applications with more than one controller it is very important to use an object to house your ng-model properties, such as order.specialInstructions.  -->
    <!-- It is best practice to always bind to an object off of the scope, in this case, "model".
        This provides a clean separation and avoids binding issues in a more complex application
    eg: $scope.model = {title: 'Our Menu'};   <h2> tag with {{model.title}}.
-->
<!-- Putting a $scope variable's name inside an Angular expression {{ }} binds it to the view, and sets up a watcher to keep up on the value. -->
<!-- (e.g. {{::model.title}}) to perform a one-time binding. - if you know a variable isn't going to change in the view, and you just want to bind its initial value,
This tells Angular to go ahead and set the value the first time, but not to set a watcher to keep up on it. This can be a useful performance boost for larger applications.-->
<!-- the $scope object can also hold functions for your view to interact with using Angular's event handlers such as ng-click, ng-mouseover, etc. -->
<!-- To Two-Way Bind a Variable with ng-model -->
<!-- By $scope variables, the communication between the view and the controller can go both ways. -->
